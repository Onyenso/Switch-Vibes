# SwitchVibes
This is the back-end API service for SwitchVibes, a platform that enables smooth music playlist migration between different music streaming services.
Simply provide the link of a playlist from your favorite source platform (e.g., Spotify), and SwitchVibes will automatically transfer all the songs to
a new playlist in your specified destination platform. Eliminate manual playlist recreation and let SwitchVibes do the heavy lifting for you.
